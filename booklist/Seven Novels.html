          <h2>Description :</h2>
          <p>
            Writing in France in the nineteenth century, Jules Verne was
            fascinated by adventure and exploration. Collecting: Five Weeks in a
            Balloon, Around the World in Eighty Days, A Journey to the Center of
            the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Round the Moon,
            Twenty-Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, The Mysterious Island. This
            omnibus offers a unique compilation of seven of Vernes Voyages,
            stories in which he extrapolated developing technology and invention
            into marvellous fiction. This volume offers readers a generous
            introduction to Jules Verne, whose books are as alive today as they
            were for readers new to the ideas expressed in them during his time.
            This edition of the text is exquisitely bound in bonded-leather,
            with distinctive gilt edging and an attractive silk-ribbon bookmark.
            Decorative, durable, and collectable, these books offer hours of
            pleasure to readers young and old and are an indispensable
            cornerstone for any home library.
