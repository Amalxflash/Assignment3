          <h2>Description :</h2>
          <p>
            Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple
            wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger and a
            snake surrounding a large letter 'H'." Harry Potter has never even
            heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at
            number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish
            parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his
            grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great
            beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some
            astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at
            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure
            is about to begin!
