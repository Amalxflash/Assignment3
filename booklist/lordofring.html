          <h2>Description :</h2>
          <p>
            In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the
            Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring,
            filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But
            the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout
            Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by
            chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. From Sauron's
            fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide.
            Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched
            for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. When Bilbo
            reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to
            his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to
            journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord,
            and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom. The Lord
            of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the
            Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry,
            Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of
            Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.
