          <h2>Description :</h2>
          <p>
            Kell is one of the last Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted
            ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and,
            once upon a time, Black. Kell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and
            officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling
            between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the
            court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any
            magic left to see. Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing
            people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world
            they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences,
            which Kell is now seeing firsthand. After an exchange goes awry,
            Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse
            with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a
            deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world
            for a proper adventure. Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery
            lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need
            to stay alive.
